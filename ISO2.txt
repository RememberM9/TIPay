💳 Project Title:
  TIPay — A Simple E-Wallet App for TIP Campus Use

❓ What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  Students, teachers, staff, and organizations at TIP have a lot of ways to pay for things like printing, events, or school items. Payments are often done by hand, which can be slow, confusing, or hard to track.

💡 What will be your solution?
  We will build a Python app that works like a digital wallet for TIP users. It will include:

  OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
    We'll create classes for User, Wallet, and Transaction. Each user will have a role(student, teacher, staff, or organization) with   different access.

  CRUD Features:
  Users can create, read, update, and delete their accounts and transactions.
  Enables shared wallets for orgs, departments, or student groups.
  Allows multiple users to view and manage the same wallet.
  Supports role-based permissions (e.g., only staff can approve withdrawals).

Database:
  We'll use SQLite to save user info, balances, and payment history.
  Obfuscation of data will be implemented for low-level security.

GUI (Graphical User Interface):
  We’ll use Tkinter to make a simple and easy-to-use interface. It will include:
    * Login and sign-up screen
    * Wallet balance and transaction history
    * Buttons for deposit, withdraw, and transfer
    * Admin panel for staff to approve or check payments
