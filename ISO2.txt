üí≥ Project Title:
  TIPay ‚Äî A Simple E-Wallet App for TIP Campus Use

‚ùì What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  Students, teachers, staff, and organizations at TIP have a lot of ways to pay for things like printing, events, or school items. Payments are often done by hand, which can be slow, confusing, or hard to track.

üí° What will be your solution?
  We will build a Python app that works like a digital wallet for TIP users. It will include:

  I. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
    We'll create classes for User, Wallet, and Transaction. Each user will have a role(student, teacher, staff, or organization) with   different access.

  II. CRUD Features:
      Users can create, read, update, and delete their accounts and transactions.

  III. Database:
      We'll use SQLite to save user info, balances, and payment history.
      Obfuscation of data will be implemented for low-level security.

  IV. GUI (Graphical User Interface):
      We‚Äôll use Tkinter to make a simple and easy-to-use interface. It will include:
      * Login and sign-up screen
      * Wallet balance and transaction history
      * Buttons for deposit, withdraw, and transfer
      * Admin panel for staff to approve or check payments
